**Finding the median value for two arrays**
Step1: I created a Function that will collect two parameters of array_1 and array_2
Step2: I find if the merged arrray is odd or even
Note: The merge array was gotten from the concatenation of the array_1 and array_2
Step3: I return the even or the odd number
Step4: I passed the arguments to the mean function
